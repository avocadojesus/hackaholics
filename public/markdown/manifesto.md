## Hackaholics

Hackaholics encourages growth through exploration. While curriculum is excellent at providing structure for learning something completely, it will fail at engaging the creative part of your brain, which will create a disconnect between the skills you are acquiring and the reasons you originally had for acquiring them. At Hackaholics, we are attempting to bridge that gap by providing our members with an exploration-rich environment.
